# Lung_infection_detection
This repository comprises of the EDA, preprocessing, the deep learning models and their evaluation for a lung infection detection from images.

### About the project :
##### Objective 
The goal of the project is to enhance the accuracy of classification of lung images.
##### Motivation 
Detection of lung infections, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis, is critical for timely diagnosis and treatment, as these conditions can lead to severe complications and even mortality if left untreated. With the increasing availability of medical imaging data, particularly chest X-rays and CT scans, there is a growing need for accurate and efficient methods to automatically identify and classify lung infections. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for this task due to their ability to learn complex spatial patterns from images, enabling precise detection and classification of lung abnormalities with high sensitivity and specificity. 

##### The key steps taken :
* The dataset is explored to  understand its characteristics, such as the distribution of classes (e.g., infected vs. non-infected), the quality of images, and any patterns
The sample images from each set have been visualized to better understand what the model will be analysing

* Preprocessing of the images, such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques has been carried out.

* Custom CNN models have been implemented.Techniques like transfer learning have been used to small dataset to leverage pre-trained models.Architecures like Mobilenet and Densenet have been explored.

* Model training and evaluation has been done.

  
* Fine-tuning of hyperparameters based on validation performance.Different architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization techniques have been experimented with to to improve model accuracy.
